       " \"Late to-night or early to-morrow he would go down the trail into\\nPackard's Grab, the valley which had been his grandfather's and,\\nbecause of a burst of reckless generosity on the part of the old man,\\nSteve's father's also.\",\n",
       " \"But never Steve's, pondered the man on the\\nhorse; word of his father's death had come to him five months ago and\\nwith it word of Phil Packard's speculations and sweeping losses.\",\n",
       " \"But never had money's coming and money's going been a serious concern\\nof Steve Packard; and now his anticipation was sufficiently keen.\",\n",
       " 'The\\nworld was his; he had no need of a legal paper to state that the small\\nfragment of the world known as Ranch Number Ten belonged to him.',\n",
       " 'He\\ncould ride upon it again, perhaps find one like old Bill Royce, the\\nforeman, left.',\n",
       " 'And then he could go on until he came to the other\\nPackard ranch where his grandfather had lived and still might be living.',\n",
       " 'After all of this--Well, there were many sunny beaches here and there\\nalong the seven seas where he had still to lie and sun himself.',\n",
       " 'Now it\\nwas a pure joy to note how the boles of pine and cedar pointed straight\\ntoward the clear, cloudless blue; how the little streams trickled\\nthrough their worn courses; how the quail scurried to their brushy\\nretreats; how the sunlight splashed warm and golden through the\\nbranches; how valleys widened and narrowed and the thickly timbered\\nravines made a delightful and tempting coolness upon the mountainsides.',\n",
       " 'It was an adventure with its own thrill to ride around a bend in the\\nnarrow trail and be greeted by an old, well-remembered landmark: a\\nflat-topped boulder where he had lain when a boy, looking up at the sky\\nand thrilling to the whispered promises of life; or a pool where he had\\nfished or swum; or a tree he had climbed or from whose branches he had\\nshot a gray squirrel.',\n",
       " 'A wagon-road which he might have taken he\\nabandoned for a trail which better suited his present fancy since it\\nled with closer intimacy into the woods.',\n",
       " 'It was late afternoon when he came to the gentle rise which gave first\\nglint of the little lake so like a blue jewel set in the dusty green of\\nthe wooded slopes.',\n",
       " 'As he rose in his stirrups to gaze down a vista\\nthrough the tree-trunks, he saw the bright, vivid blue of a cloak.',\n",

       " 'And of course she must pick out the one\\ndangerous spot on the whole lake shore to display herself on.\"',\n",
       " 'For he knew how, just yonder where the blue cloak caught the sunlight,\\nthere was a sheer bank and how the lapping water had cut into it,\\ngouging it out year after year so that the loose soil above was always\\nready to crumble and spill into the lake.',\n",
       " 'The wearer of the bright\\ngarment stirred and stood up, her back still toward him.',\n",

       " 'For he had glimpsed\\nthe quick flash of an up-thrown arm, had heard a low cry, had guessed\\nrather than seen through the low underbrush her young body falling.',\n",
       " \"As he threw himself from his horse's back, his spur caught in the blue\\ncloak which had dropped from her shoulders; he kicked at it savagely.\",\n",
       " 'He jerked off his boots, poised a moment looking down upon the\\ndisturbed surface of the water which had closed over her head, made out\\nthe sweep of an arm under the widening circles, and dived straight down.',\n",
       " 'And so deep down under water they met for the first time, Steve Packard\\nwith a sense of annoyance that was almost outright irritation, the girl\\nstruggling frantically as his right arm closed tight about her.',\n",
       " 'A\\nquick suspicion came to him that she had not fallen but had thrown\\nherself downward in some passionate quarrel with life; that she wanted\\nto die and would give him scant thanks for the rescue.',\n",
       " 'This thought was followed by the other that in her access of terror she\\nwas doing what the drowning person always does--losing her head,\\nthreatening to bind his arms with her own and drag him down with her.',\n",
       " 'Struggling half blindly and all silently they rose a little toward the\\nsurface.',\n",
       " 'Packard tightened his grip about her body, managed to\\nimprison one of her arms against her side, beat at the water with his\\nfree hand, and so, just as his lungs seemed ready to burst, he brought\\nhis nostrils into the air.',\n",
       " 'He drew in a great breath and struck out mightily for the shore,\\nseeking a less precipitous bank at the head of a little cove.',\n",
       " 'As he\\ndid so, he noted how her struggles had suddenly given over, how she\\nfloated quietly with him, her free arm even aiding in their progress.',\n",
       " 'A little later he crawled out of the clear, cold water to a pebbly\\nbeach, drawing her after him.',\n",
       " 'And now he understood that his destiny and his own headlong nature had\\nagain made a consummate fool of him.',\n",
       " 'The same knowledge was offered\\nhim freely in a pair of gray eyes which fairly blazed at him.',\n",
       " 'No\\ngratitude there of a maiden heroically succored in the hour of her\\nsupreme distress; just the leaping anger of a girl with a temper like\\nhot fire who had been rudely handled by a stranger.',\n",
       " 'Her scanty little bathing-suit, bright blue like the discarded cloak,\\nthe red rubber cap binding the bronze hair--she must have donned the\\nridiculous thing with incredible swiftness while he batted an\\neye--might have been utterly becoming in other eyes than those of Steve\\nPackard.',\n",
       " 'Now that they merely told him that he was a blundering ass,\\nhe was conscious solely of a desire to pick her up and shake her.',\n",
       " '\"Gee!\"',\n",

       " \"Later, perhaps, he would admit that she was undeniably and most\\namazingly pretty; that the curves of her little white body were\\ndelightfully perfect; that she had made an armful that at another time\\nwould have put sheer delirium into a man's blood.\",\n",
       " 'Just now he knew only that in his moment of nothing less than stupidity\\nhe had angered her and that his own anger though more unreasonable was\\nscarcely less heated; that he had made and still made but a sorry\\nspectacle; that he was sopping wet and cold and would be shivering in a\\nmoment like a freezing dog.',\n",
       " '\"Why did you want to yell like a Comanche Indian when you went in?\"',\n",

       " 'Packard felt the afternoon breeze through the wet garments which stuck\\nso close to him, and shivered.',\n",

       " 'He bestowed upon her a glance whose purpose was to wither her.',\n",
       " 'It\\nfailed miserably, partly because she was patently not the sort to be\\nwithered by a look from a mere man, and partly because a violent and\\ninopportune shiver shook him from head to foot.',\n",
       " \"Until now there had been only bright anger in the girl's eyes.\",\n",
       " 'Suddenly the light there changed; what had begun as a sniff at him\\naltered without warning into a highly amused giggle.',\n",
